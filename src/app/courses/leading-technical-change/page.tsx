const ltcBodyText = `How can we help our software teams get stronger? Faster? Smarter? Happier? More positive and more productive?

There are lots of ideas about what changes we might desire to make, ranging from process to policy to procedure to skillset. There‚Äôs no problem in finding proposed changes. No, the problem is in helping your team to actually make any given change.

Leading Technical Change (LTC), is a course designed to focus on how to make change, not which change to make.

const courseLeaderBodyText = `My name is GeePaw Hill, and I have been helping software development teams to find the path to ‚Äúbetter‚Äù for just over 25 years. I have worked with over a hundred different teams, in every flavor of software development.

I have helped dozens of teams adopt ‚Äì and adapt ‚Äì new ideas to their particular custom circumstances. And there are always custom circumstances. Now, I am wanting to share what I have learned, in a short, intimate, live, remote course, called ‚ÄúLeading Technical Change‚Äù (LTC).

LTC is composed of 4 2-hour sessions, distributed across a single week. Each offering of the course is limited to just 6 attendees.

In those 8 hours, LTC develops the theory of change, then offers a variety of hardcore techniques, and finally, case-by-case analysis and advice about the real change-problems facing each attendee.`;

const theoryOfChangeBodyText = `Many people, conceiving of some change they want to make, focus all of their attention only on the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù of that particular change.  But successful change, *any* successful change, depends at least as much on the ‚Äúhow‚Äù as on the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù.

The  theory of change we‚Äôll be working with in the course is based around research on ‚Äúcognitive frames‚Äù, the short-hand pre-assembled bits and pieces that actually underlie most day-to-day action. We can‚Äôt eliminate frames (and we wouldn‚Äôt want to), we can only change their shape.

Doing that involves three abstract strategies:

Take many more much smaller steps (MMMSS).
Optimize for the humans (OFTH).
Make Change Normal (MCN).
From these three broad strategies, we can develop specific, powerful tactics to increase the likelihood that our changes will really work, and really stick.`;
